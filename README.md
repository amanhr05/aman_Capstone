The design demonstrates the various user actions, layouts, and components necessary for a responsive web application. The mockup also establishes the visual aesthetics of the application, including colors, fonts, and branding.

## 2. Design Elements and User Actions
The mockup covers the following core user actions:
- **Selecting Difficulty Level**: Users can select a difficulty level (Easy, Medium, or Hard) before fetching a question.
- **Displaying Quiz Question and Answers**: A quiz question is displayed with multiple choice answers. Users can select an answer and submit it.
- **Correct/Incorrect Feedback**: After submitting an answer, users receive feedback indicating whether their choice was correct or incorrect.
- **Score Tracking**: The number of correct and incorrect answers is displayed, updated after each question.
- **Reset Button**: Users can reset their score using a clear and easily accessible reset button.

## 3. Responsive Layouts
The mockup demonstrates the layout for both desktop and mobile screen sizes:
- **Desktop Layout**: The form, question, and answer sections are displayed side by side for easy navigation and visibility on larger screens.
- **Mobile Layout**: On smaller screens, the elements stack vertically, ensuring readability and accessibility without clutter.
  
Both layouts ensure the application is fully responsive, offering a consistent experience across various devices.

## 5. User Experience Considerations
The design prioritizes simplicity and usability, ensuring that users can quickly:
- Select a difficulty level

The color scheme ensures that feedback (correct/incorrect answers) is immediately recognizable, enhancing user engagement.

## 6. Mockup Software
